This is the second game I have ever made. This was produced my senior year of high school. The game features a character falling down a randomly generated tunnel with procedural obstacles with increasing speed and difficulty. Coins and gems can be collected in order to upgrade existing characters or purchase new ones. Each character has his/her own special abilities.
